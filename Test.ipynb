    "\n",
    "In this project, I want to find key drivers of property value for single family properties. I want to make recommendations on which features predict home values well and those that don't. I want to present visualizations, analyses, and tests to support these claims. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    " \n",
    "- Perform EDA on Zillow dataset to see which features predict house prices well.\n",
    "- Construct a ML Regression model that predicts property values.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Initial Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "I think sqft and bedrooms will be the biggest predictors of home value. I also think location will be a big predictor, but this will require feature engineering.\n",

    " \n",
    "* **Acquire** zillow data from MySQL\n",

    "    1. Inspect raw data and note any desired transformations which may include any of the following:\n",
    "        * Drop unnecessary columns (duplicate, redundant columns)\n",
    "        * Handle missing values and impute appropriate values\n",
    "            * check for explicit missing values (e.g. `np.nan`)\n",
    "            * check for implicit missing values (e.g. whitespace, `'unknown'`, etc.)\n",
    "        * Deal with any duplicate rows/homes (with same info, id's, or location).\n",
    "        * Numeric columns should be numeric data types\n",
    "        * Numeric data should be scaled appropriately\n",

    "    1. Split the data\n",
    "        * Determine if homes have county imbalance. If, so stratify.\n",
